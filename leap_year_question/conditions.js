// * "Leap year question" is a term used to denote years where the number of days in a calendar year is one day more than usual. This extra day is achieved by adding February 29th to the normally 28-day long February. To determine if a year is a leap year, the following algorithm is used: For a year to be a leap year, it must satisfy the following two conditions:

// * 1-The year must be divisible by 4.
// * 2-The year must not be divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

// * Apart from these conditions, in years that do not meet these criteria, February has 28 days, while in leap years, it has 29 days. Given this information, write a code in JavaScript to determine if a year is a leap year or not.
